Ideas in the Running!
</h1>

<b> <p> I am tring to find out as much as I can by scowering the web for ideas and code samples to use to cheese this as much as possible. </p>
<p> This github may be too risky to copy from but we may get some ideas to work off of. </p>
<p> <a href="<a href="url">link text</a>"> Ldap GitHub</a> </p>

<p> As far as the base text in the files I created. I am going through the text and modifying as I read it and ajusting it. </p>
<p> So as soon as we can set up the program that would be nice. Meanwhile I am trying to get the Ldap code for accessing the server done. </p>
